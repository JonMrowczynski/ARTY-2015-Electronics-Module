# Camp Circuits

This repository contains some of my electronics work for the 2015 Arty summer robotics camp. 

Specifically, it contains the documents used to help implement the electronics module, where the campers learned about common electrical components and simple circuits through hands-on experience.

You can find more information about Arty here: http://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/techne-institute/programs-events/arty.html

## Requirements

- You will need Microsoft Word in order to read "Circuit Guide". This guide includes the circuit designs which can be individually viewed by opening the corresponding PDF file.

- The PDFs of the circuit designs can be read by using any PDF reader.

- If you would like to modify the circuit designs, or view the actualy schematics used to make the PDFs, you will need to download and install Autodesk Eagle, a link to which can be found here: https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download

The installation process should be pretty self-explanatory. Afterwards, you should be able to open the schematics and edit them.
