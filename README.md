# ARTY 2015 Electronics Module

This repository contains the documents I made that were used to help implement the electronics module for the 2015 Art, Robotics, and Technology for Youth (ARTY) Summer Workshop where campers learned about electrical components and circuits through hands-on experiences.

You can find more information about ARTY 2015 [here](http://www.buffalo.edu/ubnow/featured-stories.host.html/content/shared/university/news/news-center-releases/2015/07/019.detail.html).

## Requirements

- Microsoft Word or LibreOffice to read/modify "Circuit Guide.docx", which includes all of the information required to perform the electronics module.

- Any PDF reader to view the PDFs of the schematics.

- [Autodesk Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download) >= 9.5 if you would like to modify the schematics.
